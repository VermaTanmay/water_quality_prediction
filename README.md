##For potable water quality, you should aim to have values that align with safe drinking water standards. Below are typical recommended ranges for various water quality parameters:

##General Guidelines for Potable Water Quality:
pH: 6.5 to 8.5
Hardness: < 300 mg/L
Solids: < 500 mg/L
Chloramines: < 4 mg/L
Sulfate: < 250 mg/L
Conductivity: < 700 μS/cm
Organic Carbon: < 2 mg/L
Trihalomethanes: < 100 μg/L
Turbidity: < 1 NTU
